This is the web-application component of VASP.

VASP is a prototype health diagnosis web-app tool which won the WolfHacks 2021 Hackathon. Our team designed a multi-functional sensor (through AutoCAD/Arduino) to collect various medical information from a patient. The web-application is intended to receive this information and display it, as well as identify potential problems the patient may have. An embedded google maps view shows the patient local pharmacies which may have the appropriate medication in stock. 

The arduino device is programmed through C++, and the web-app component in PUG/Jade.
