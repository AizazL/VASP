**VASP** is a prototype health diagnosis web-app tool that won 1st Place at the TurnerHacks 2021 Hackathon. Our team designed a multi-functional sensor using AutoCAD and Arduino to collect various medical data from patients. The web application is engineered to receive and display this information, providing insights into potential health issues. Additionally, an embedded Google Maps view helps patients locate local pharmacies with appropriate medications in stock.

## Project Overview

- **Sensor Design**: The multi-functional sensor was designed using AutoCAD and implemented via Arduino. It is capable of collecting various medical metrics from the patient.
- **Web Application**: The web-app component, developed using PUG/Jade, serves as the interface where collected data is displayed and analyzed.
- **Integrated Mapping**: A Google Maps view is embedded within the application, allowing patients to locate nearby pharmacies that may have the necessary medications available.

## Technical Details

- **Arduino Programming**: The sensor device was programmed in C++.
- **Web Technologies**: The web application was built using PUG/Jade, providing a streamlined and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Collection**: The sensor collects and transmits medical data to the web application in real-time.
- **Health Issue Identification**: The application analyzes the collected data and identifies potential health issues that the patient may have.
- **Pharmacy Locator**: The integrated Google Maps view helps patients find local pharmacies that stock the required medications.
