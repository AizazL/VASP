# VASP FILE

This is the web-application component of VASP.

VASP is a prototype web application and is a proof-of-concept in it's current form. Our team designed a multi-functional sensor (through AutoCAD/demonstrated through Arduino) to collect various medical information from a patient. The web-application is intended to receive this information and display it, as well as identify potential problems the patient may have. An embedded google maps view is meant to show the patient local pharmacies which may have the appropriate medication in stock.
